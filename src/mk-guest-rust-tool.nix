# Build a Rust guest utility cross-compiled for one target arch as a
# static-musl binary. Copied from penguin-tools/src/mk-guest-rust-tool.nix so
# this repo builds itself standalone.
#
# Unlike the upstream Docker build, we do NOT use the crate's .cargo/config:
# it hardcodes linker paths into a /opt/cross toolchain that only exists inside
# the embedded-toolchains image. nixpkgs' cross rustPlatform injects the correct
# linker via CARGO_TARGET_<triple>_LINKER, so we strip that file.
#
#   crossPkgs -- a musl cross nixpkgs (archs.nix muslCrossSystem) for a fully
#                static guest binary.
#   src       -- the (forked) crate source tree (must contain Cargo.lock).
#   pname     -- derivation name.
#   binName   -- the produced binary (defaults to pname).

  # crates.io returns HTTP 403 to nixpkgs' crate fetcher: it sends a generic
  # `curl/*` User-Agent to the crates.io API download endpoint
  # (https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>/<ver>/download), which crates.io's
  # crawler policy now refuses. The static.crates.io CDN serves the identical
  # bytes (same sha256, so the lockfile checksums still validate) with no UA gate.
  #
  # Point the crate DOWNLOAD at the CDN via importCargoLock's `extraRegistries`,
  # while leaving Cargo.lock CANONICAL (crates stay on the real crates.io-index).
  # Keeping the lock canonical is essential: a rewritten lock source makes
  # `cargo build --frozen` (cargoBuildHook) reject the lock, and penguin builds
  # this tool as a flake input against an OLDER nixpkgs (nixpkgs.follows) whose
  # importCargoLock/buildRustPackage APIs differ -- `cargoLock` + `extraRegistries`
  # is the one crate-source path both accept.

  # Force a fully static binary. nixpkgs' musl Rust defaults to DYNAMIC linking
  # (interpreter + libc.so/libgcc_s.so.1 in /nix/store) -- unusable in the guest,
  # which has no /nix/store. The cargoSetupHook generates a per-target
  # [target.<triple>].rustflags with "-Ctarget-feature=-crt-static" (the minus
  # because a plain musl cross isn't isStatic). RUSTFLAGS env outranks that
  # target config in cargo's precedence, so we restate the flags with crt-static
  # flipped on; the hook's separate "linker" key still selects the cross linker.

  # cargo's built-in [source.crates-io]; cargo then aborts on the duplicate
  # crates-io definition ("source registry `crates-io` already defined"). The
  # built-in [source.crates-io] replace-with = vendored-sources already vendors
  # every crate (the lock is canonical), so the extra block is pure redundancy --
  # strip it. cargoSetupHook writes the merged config to a `.cargo/config`

  # runs before stdenv cd's into sourceRoot, so the file lands in the BUILD ROOT
  # one level up -- cargo reads it by walking up. Strip both the sourceRoot copy
  # and the parent, both filenames. Runs in preConfigure, after that hook.
